# Diagnosing_Heart_Disease

 The data for this project is used from Kaggle-

                      ---------------------------------- Data Description-------------------------------

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Attribute Information-
1) Age (age in years)
2) Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3) CP (chest pain type)
4) TRESTBPS (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
5) CHOL (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)
6) FPS (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7) RESTECH (resting electrocardiographic results)
8) THALACH (maximum heart rate achieved)
9) EXANG (exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no))
10) OLDPEAK (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
11) SLOPE (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
12) CA (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy)
13) THAL (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
14) TARGET (1 or 0)

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.
